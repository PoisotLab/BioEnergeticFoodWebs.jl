**Rewiring graph**

(Based on Staniczenko et al., 2010)
This function calculate the rewiring graph R from the adjacency matrix A.
The rewiring graph indicates biologically plausible trophic rewiring.
R[i,j] = 1 if i and j share at least one predator AND i has at least one predator
that does not prey on j (i is in that case an overlap species).
