We do not perform any check on whether or not the user-supplied body-mass vector is correct (mostly because there is no way of defining correctness for vectors where body-mass of producers are not equal to unity). It is possible to turn off the scaling (scale_bodymass = false), in that case we strongly recommend setting scale_growth = true ( and possibly scale_metabolism = true and scale_maxcons = true).\n\nThe keyword vertebrates is an array of true or false for every species in the matrix. If the vector is of size 1 (e.g. [false]), all species will take this metabolic status. By default, all species are invertebrates.\n\nA rewiring method can pe passed to specified if the foodweb should be rewired following extinctions events, and the method that should be used to perform the rewiring. This rewire_method keyword can be eighter :none (no rewiring), :ADBM (allometric diet breadth model as described in Petchey et al., 2008), :DS (rewiring mechanism used by Gilljam et al., 2015, based on diet similarity) or :DO (rewiring mechanism used by Staniczenko et al, 2010, based on diet overlap).\n\nIf rewire_methodis :ADBM or :DS, additional keywords can be passed. See the online documentation and the original references for more details.\n\nTemperature dependence for metabolic rates and body masses can be implemented, please check the documentation for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"lib/internals/#BioEnergeticFoodWebs.check_initial_parameters","page":"Internal Documentation","title":"BioEnergeticFoodWebs.check_initial_parameters","text":"Check initial parameters\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"lib/internals/#BioEnergeticFoodWebs.check_parameters","page":"Internal Documentation","title":"BioEnergeticFoodWebs.check_parameters","text":"Are the simulation parameters present?\n\nThis function will make sure that all the required parameters are here, and that the arrays and matrices have matching dimensions.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"lib/public/#Public-Documentation-1","page":"Public Documentation","title":"Public Documentation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"lib/public/#","page":"Public Documentation","title":"Public Documentation","text":"Documentation for BioEnergeticFoodWebs's public (exported) interface.","category":"page"},{"location":"lib/public/#","page":"Public Documentation","title":"Public Documentation","text":"See Internal Documentation for documentation on internal functions.","category":"page"},{"location":"lib/public/#Contents-1","page":"Public Documentation","title":"Contents","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"lib/public/#","page":"Public Documentation","title":"Public Documentation","text":"Pages = [\"public.md\"]","category":"page"},{"location":"lib/public/#Index-1","page":"Public Documentation","title":"Index","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"lib/public/#","page":"Public Documentation","title":"Public Documentation","text":"Pages = [\"public.md\"]","category":"page"},{"location":"lib/public/#Setting-up-simulations-1","page":"Public Documentation","title":"Setting up simulations","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"lib/public/#","page":"Public Documentation","title":"Public Documentation","text":"model_parameters","category":"page"},{"location":"lib/public/#Generating-networks-1","page":"Public Documentation","title":"Generating networks","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"lib/public/#","page":"Public Documentation","title":"Public Documentation","text":"nichemodel","category":"page"},{"location":"lib/public/#BioEnergeticFoodWebs.nichemodel","page":"Public Documentation","title":"BioEnergeticFoodWebs.nichemodel","text":"Niche model of food webs\n\nTakes a number of species S and a number of interactions L, and returns a food web with predators in rows, and preys in columns.
